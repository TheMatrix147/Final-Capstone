# Stress And Sleep Analysis

### By Derek Smith

## Project Overview Description:

#### Project Purpose: 
This project is intended to research the effects of stress on sleep duration and quality, and to verify distinct sleeping patterns that can occur as a result of stress. 
#### Background on Research Problem:
Many individuals suffer chronic symptoms of mild to severe insomnia, and this can be very disrupting to one's happiness, functionality, and
quality of life. Insomnia can be experienced by anyone for a number of underlying reasons. This analysis will specifically focus on determining whether or not stress levels are a potential cause of sleep disorders like insomnia. 
#### Existing Research: 
The datasets used in this analyis were sourced from kaggle.com, an open source dataset and data science platform. Research was done by the authors on several different factors that can influence sleep, including one's occupation, physical activity level, stress level, etc. In this analysis, particular interest is shown in the inluence stress levels can have on sleep. Research was also done to detect different sleeping patterns based on certain variables such as a person's snoring rate, respiration rate, eye movement, etc. 

## Analysis Questions:

1. Is there a correlation between stress levels and sleep duration/quality?

2. Are there distinct sleep patterns among individuals experiencing different stress levels?

# Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Summary Statistics
Using PANDAS methods, I analyzed the summary statistics and data types for both datasets. Missing data was also checked for. Based on the summary statistics, most of the variables in each dataset seem to follow a roughly normal distribution, with a few exceptions where there might be a slight skew. For each variable, a boxplot was created to better observe the nature of the distribution in greater detail according to its interquartile range.

#### Hypothesis Testing:
For the first dataset, the goal was to determine if a correlation existed between stress levels and sleep duration/quality, a hypothesis test was conducted using the pearsonr and spearmanr python methods. A null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis were formed for both the sleep duration and sleep quality variables. The results of the pearsonr and spearmanr methods indicated that a very strong correlation exists between stress levels and sleep duration/quality. For the second dataset, the objective was to see if a correlation existed between stress levels and other variables that formed distinct sleeping patterns such as faster heart rate, lower body temperture, lower blood oxygen levels, etc. Using the pearsonr and spearmanr methods again, the results indicated that a very strong correlation also exists between stress levels and these variables. Hence, the null hypotheses were rejected. 

#### Basic Visuals
For the primary variables of concern in the first dataset, it was noted that sleep quality and duration decreased in a linear fashion as stress levels increased when the stress level variable was on the horizontal axis. For major variables in the second dataset, the snoring rate, respiration rate, limb movement, eye movement, and heart rate all increased linearly, while blood oxygen, body temperature, and sleeping hours decreased linearly when the stress level variable was on the horizontal axis. A scatterplot, KDE plot, and pairplot were all used to make these analyses. 

# Data Wrangling 

### Data Cleansing and Organization
For this section, I checked for any punctuation or spelling errors in column names, or for column names that needed to be made lowercase and snake case and changed those accordingly. I scanned for variables and data types that weren't matching and changed those data types to the correct ones. I checked for any missing values and filled those using the variable's mode. I also checked for outliers by creating boxplot visualizations and applying the zscore method. I ensured that both datasets followed a Tidy Data format. 

### Feature Engineering
For my first dataset, I used the one-hot encoding method/dummy variables to replace all nominal categories. This resulted in several new columns with boolean values in integer form. For my second dataset, no categorical variables needed to be re-expressed since all of the variables were quantitative. 

# Statistical Analysis

#### Hypothesis Testing:
For the first dataset, I formulated a null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis based on determining whether or not a cause-and-effect relationship exists between stress levels and sleep quality/duration. For the second dataset, I created a null and alternative hypothesis based on determining whether or not a cause-and-effect relationship exists between stress levels and distinct sleeping patterns such as more rapid eye and limb movements, and decreasing body temperature and blood oxygen levels. 

#### Regression Analysis:
For both datasets, a simple linear regression was performed to determine if stress levels really do have an effect on one's sleep quality/duration and sleeping patterns. After each regression, results for the model's r-squared, co-efficients, and p-value metrics were analyzed, all of which denoted for each regression that the models were significant and that stress levels indeed have an effect on the variables that were being tested. Thus, the null hypotheses were rejected. 

# Project Findings/Conclusion
Overall, the results of this project suggest that stress plays a major role in one's daily life of sleep. Not only can very strong correlations be seen between an individual's stress level and sleep quality/duration and sleeping patterns, but also an actual cause-and-effect relationship between each.
